# Coursera.CleaningData-Project
It is a repository created to fulfill the Coursera Johns Hopkins Course of "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The data was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
then I unzip the data in a folder into a directory used to the course activities. The firs part of the code take this
into account changing the working directory to where the data was extracted.

Then it follows the sequence of instructions given in the project: (1) Create a unique data set that bind together
the train andd the test set, (2) Choose the statistics used to characterize the data (mean and SD), (3) Label the data set with suitable names for each activities, (4) Create a new tidy data set and write it in a .txt file
